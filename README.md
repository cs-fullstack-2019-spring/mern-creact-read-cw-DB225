Create a movie database fullstack application with the following:

## Model:
- movieName: String,
- genre: String,
- cast: {
- - mainActor: String,
- - mainActress: String,
- - supportingActor: String,
- - supportingActress: String,
<br>},

## Pages:
<strong>Home Page</strong>: Only a H1 welcome to the page

<strong>List all movies</strong>: List all movies here from the database

<strong>Add a movie</strong>: Add the movie name and genre. NOTHING ELSE AT THIS TIME

<hr><hr><hr>

### Challenge 1:
- Include an edit button next to each movie that will allow you to add the cast of a movie.

### Challenge 2:
- Only show the cast information that is not blank on the listing page.

### Challenge 3:
- Style the movie information using a grid in a grid (similar to Bootstrap Cards)
